# Plug-and-Play Collaboration Between Specialized Tsetlin Machines

This project introduces plug-and-play teaming of specialized Tsetlin machines (TMs), fostering collaboration. 
* The collaboration relies on a TM's ability to specialize during learning and to assess its competence during inference.
* When teaming up, the most confident TMs step in and make the decisions, relieving the uncertain ones. In this manner, the team becomes more competent than its members, benefitting from their specializations.
* The project implements four TM specializations as a demonstration:
  * Histogram of Gradients;
  * Adaptive Thresholding w/10x10 convolution;
  * Color Thermometers w/3x3 convolution;
  * Color Thermometers w/4x4 convolution.
* The members can be combined in any manner, at any time, without any form of fine-tuning, making the approach plug-and-play.

The above teaming gives the new state-of-the-art performance for TMs across Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, increasing accuracy on Fashion-MNIST by two percentage points, CIFAR-10 by twelve points, and CIFAR-100 by nine points.

## Architecture

The plug-and-play architecture is visualized below.

As seen, each member TM outputs its class sum per class, with the class sum signifying confidence. In the ensuing normalization step, the class sums of each TM are divided by the difference between the TM's largest and smallest class sum in the dataset.
